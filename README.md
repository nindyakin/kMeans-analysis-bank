**Project Information**

This project is one of the Python projects I have worked on as part of my participation in the Full Stack Data Analyst course at RevoU. The dataset utilized is a dummy dataset with a case study on Revo Bank.


***A. Business Description***

RevoBank is an European bank that provides credit cards to their customers. Current assignments is within the Credit Cards tribe, which aims to increase the usage of RevoBank credit cards in partnership with various merchants.
Today is January 31 2023. Over the past 6 months, RevoBank implemented a new promotion in one of their partners (RevoShop), exclusively for credit card users. The promotion involves distributing RevoShop vouchers to all RevoBank customers via email or SMS. When users redeem vouchers on eligible transactions, the receive 15 credit card reward points, equivalent to 1.5 euro. There are no limits on the number of transactions a user can redeem, and RevoBank covers the full cost of the promotion.


***B. Objective and Tasks***

The objective based on the Card Partnership Lead at RevoBank are :


1.   To know transaction behaviour (spending patterns for 6 months promotion time) among RevoShop customers who are RevoBank credit card users.
2.   To find a ways to reduce the cost of the promotion.

As a data analyst in the tribe, our **tasks** are as follows :


1.   Provide an overview of the promotion program's performance from RevoBank's perspective.
2.   Identify different segments of RevoBank credit card users who are RevoShop customers.
3.    Discover business opportunities to customize the program for each customer segment.
